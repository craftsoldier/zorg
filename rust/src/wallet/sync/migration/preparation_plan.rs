//! Note-preparation transaction planning: how to restructure a wallet's spendable source-pool notes
//! into the exact self-funding notes a migration run needs, using transactions that each stay within
//! the [ZIP 318] action budget.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! The [`note_splitting`](super::note_splitting) planner decides the *values* of the self-funding
//! notes to mint. This module decides the *transactions* that mint them. [ZIP 318] requires each
//! note-preparation transaction to be padded to exactly [`PREP_TX_ACTIONS`] Orchard actions (a
//! mobile-proving-time and on-chain-uniformity constraint). Under NU6.3 a bundle's action count is
//! its spends plus its outputs, so one transaction can consume and produce at most
//! [`PREP_TX_ACTIONS`] notes in total (for example 15 spends and one output when consolidating, or
//! one spend and 15 outputs when splitting). A splitting transaction therefore mints MANY funding
//! notes at once, one output per scheduled part (up to [`FUNDING_OUTPUTS_PER_TX`]); the number of
//! funding notes in a preparation transaction is not one. The one-transaction-per-part shape belongs
//! to the phase-2 crossing transfers (each spends a single funding note), not to preparation.
//!
//! A single transaction therefore cannot always turn the wallet's notes into every funding note: a
//! note that must fan out into more outputs than one transaction holds, or a balance spread across
//! more SUB-QUANTUM notes (each below the smallest funding denomination, so too small to fund a
//! crossing on its own; not to be confused with sub-fee "dust") than one transaction can consume,
//! needs **layers**. A layer is a set of
//! transactions with no dependencies between them (buildable, provable, and broadcastable in
//! parallel); a later layer may spend the outputs of an earlier one, but only after they are mined
//! and a boundary passes, so each extra layer extends the preparation phase by roughly one anchor
//! bucket. The planner therefore prefers fewer layers (which dominate the wall-clock) over fewer
//! transactions.
//!
//! # The strategy
//!
//! The planner is a largest-first layered greedy. In each layer it feeds each output transaction from
//! the largest available note it can (one big note funds up to [`FUNDING_OUTPUTS_PER_TX`] funding
//! notes), routes every leftover forward as an intermediate ("feeder") note, and consolidates
//! sub-quantum notes (too small to fund anything on their own) into feeder notes. Once all funding
//! notes are scheduled it consolidates the feeders that no layer spent into a single residual note,
//! matching ZIP 318's "one note per part plus at most one residual note". For a typical wallet (a few
//! notes, a handful of funding notes) this is a single layer; extra layers appear only for a lone
//! large note fanning out into many funding notes, or a sub-quantum-heavy balance.
//!
//! The single-residual goal is only reachable above the fee threshold. When several transactions each
//! strand a remainder smaller than a transaction fee and those remainders together are still worth
//! less than one fee, no consolidation can merge them (its output would be negative), so they remain
//! as multiple sub-fee change notes. The planner therefore guarantees at most one residual note worth a
//! fee; any further residue is sub-fee dust.
//!
//! When a single note can produce every funding note, the planner takes a fan-out fast path: it splits
//! that note through a BALANCED tree (fanning out by [`FUNDING_OUTPUTS_PER_TX`] per layer), so the
//! depth is logarithmic in the funding-note count rather than linear in it. The balanced tree uses more
//! transactions, and so more fee, than a linear feeder chain would; it trades that for fewer layers,
//! which dominate the wall-clock. Every other shape (many notes, mixed sizes, sub-quantum) uses the
//! layered greedy above.
//!
//! This is a pure planner: it works in note *values* (in zatoshi) and does no cryptography or I/O. It
//! reserves a fixed per-transaction fee (the caller passes the ZIP-317 fee of a padded
//! [`PREP_TX_ACTIONS`]-action transaction) out of each transaction's inputs; the builder later
//! absorbs the real fee into the change.
